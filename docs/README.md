A p2p fact sharing network

# Wolfram Mega

Mega *(from מַגָע, contact)* - is a lightweight infinitely scalable decentralized data marketplace, bringing authentic observers to blockchain.

## Description

Mega acts as a p2p oracle advertisement network.

Mega relies on Proof-Of-Work in order to assign identities to oracles. It models real-life aquisition of identity: though physical effort!

Oracle's reputation is managed as a set of verifiable reports of malleability. Traders also do some PoW (for spam-protection) in order to report malicious oracle. Oracle's credibility can be estimated from a sum of PoW done on reports, or subjectively based on contents of reports ([Manifest](manifest.md)).

Everything is stored in Mega's mempools. No blockchain required for the network.

Mega supports advertisement for trading offers. Offer format allows expression of any meaningful type of contract: from binary options to "perpetual" swaps ([Trader](trader.md)).

Trader's contract are private from oracle's supervision. Oracle is not aware of trader's blockchain at all. Pull-based model ([Oracle](oracle.md))
